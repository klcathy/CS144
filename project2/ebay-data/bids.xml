        <Description>I am selling a set of 6 coasters with different characters on them. One is a ballerina with a pink and red dress. Another is a bartender with a big mustache mixing a drink. There is a man in his green pajamas (I think) holding his head with stars swimming around his head (possibly a headache). Next is a couple of drunks sitting by a lamppost. And the last two are the same of a dancer with a top hat sitting on a stool with a drink in his hand. These appear to be for a bar. I'm not sure how the ballerina fits into the picture. There is one other coaster that came with the set that is being listed seperately. It is a black man playing a saxaphone. If you are interested in it be sure to look at my auction. But note it will end a day earlier than this group. Also there is a coaster with no character that I will throw in if the winning bidder wants it. They need to let me know. These coasters are really, really cute. They are in great shape with no chips or cracks. The colors are very bright and nothing missing. There are some brown spots here and there, but you have to have them in good light to see the spots. I really believe the winning bidder is going to love them! There is no reserve. The buyer will be responsible for shipping charges and insurance if requested. I need to hear from you within 3 days after auction ends. Payment must be received within 10 days. I accept money orders, cashier checks, or personal checks that will need to clear. Don't forget to check out the other coaster! Thanks for looking and good luck bidding. E-mail if you have questions.</Description>
